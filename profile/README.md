# AiDz Suite
AiDz is a collection of cheats, tools, and scripts to assist you in anything you need to learn about BrickPlanet.  
  
Due to the games very undocumented API I decided to reverse 80% of it's functionality and document it all. I have written a script executor to teach you the internals, a market notifier to teach you how their API works, exploit scripts to teach you how to use their scripting API, a [blog](https://fish-sticks.github.io/) to show you how to reverse the game, and some notes from what I have learned.
  
You may join the [AiDz community](https://discord.gg/8VmZQyd5WZ) if you have any questions, requests, or want to chat with fellow engineers.
Please DM me if you have to contact me regarding important circumstances. I am more than willing to have a chat.
